CK2 Mod Norse Colonization of Americas

# Contribute with us on GitHub

### Players & Followers

This is a version of the mod that is constantly updated. Therefore, it is not recommended to use if you want to play a game. 
If you do, however, want to help us testing the mod or join our team, please PM or contact us in some way and we will give you directions. 
The Git version will never receive any support and bug reports on it will be ignored.


### Developers & Testers

Like this repository contains more than the game, it is not possible to clone directly Git repo inside mod folder.
To run the mod from a Git local repository:
- Clone the repository to Git default location (for instance C:\Users\username\Github\)
- Run [create_link.bat](create_link.bat) to create symbolic links from CK2 mod folder to the actual folders in your Git working directory

### Commits & Pull Requests

As we use GitHub, some guidelines are needed. Therefore, we would like to ask you the following: 
- Before making any new commit to master, please check your code (either by using the [Validator](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?597480-The-Validator-Find-errors-quickly-and-with-minimal-pain!/page75), or reading it through) in order to avoid any issues.
- If you are doing any change to the mod (major or minor), please add a mention to it in [project-vinland/Changelog.txt](project-vinland/Changelog.txt), in order for us to easier make public releases and keep track of changes. 
It is better to have a too full changelog rather than a one that is incomplete.
